Audio Steganography is hiding a message in sounds!
Since we're hiding a message in sounds, we probably wouldn;t want the others to hear the encoded message in the original sound, so we either use a noisy audio message or a subtle *

Some forms of audio steganography:
1. Phase Coding
    - Frequency shifting

2. Spread Spectrum
    - Uses a key that both the encoder and receiver know to "multiply" the message and encode it into the audio file.

3. <b>Echo Hiding</b>
    - Hiding data in an echo

4. Visual Wave Images
    - Hiding data visually in wave graphs of audio
    - Doom did this in their sound track!

5. Least Significant Bit
    - Similar to stegohide

6. Ciphers
    - Examples: morse code, musical cryptograms

## What is Echo Hiding?

Echo hiding is encoding data into audio in the form of echoes that are imperceptible to the human ear. 

It works by shifting the phase by a small amount.
