Audio Steganography is hiding a message in sounds!
Since we're hiding a message in sounds, we probably wouldn;t want the others to hear the encoded message in the original sound, so we either use a noisy audio message or a subtle *

Some forms of audio steganography:
1. Phase Coding
2. Spread Spectrum
3. Echo Hiding
4. Visual Wave Images
5. Ciphers

## What is Echo Hiding?

Echo hiding is encoding data into audio in the form of echoes that are imperceptible to the human ear. 

It works by shifting the phase by a small amount.
